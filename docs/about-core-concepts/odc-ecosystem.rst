The Open Data Cube Ecosystem
============================

The Open Data Cube (ODC) software ecosystem is made up of a number of :term:`Python` packages, 
which are described in :doc:`extensions`.

Importantly, you may need different parts of the ecosystem depending on 
your use case. To help you identify how you might best use the Open Data Cube, 
consider whether you want to manage data, process data, or both!

Managing Data
-------------

In the :abbr:`ODC (Open Data Cube)` ecosystem, managing means curating and 
organising data so that people can find the data they want. 
The :abbr:`ODC (Open Data Cube)` uses metadata to organise the data.
The metadata includes the data's spatial and temporal information, 
creation, lineage, and versioning.

This aspect of the :abbr:`ODC (Open Data Cube)` is for 
data providers and holders, be they large organisations with 
their own satellites or individuals with bespoke collections 
of Earth observation data.

To read more about managing data, see :doc:`architecture-guide`.

Working With Data
-----------------

In the :abbr:`ODC (Open Data Cube)` ecosystem, working with data could be 
displaying a true-colour image by combining the red, green, and blue bands from a multispectral sensor, 
or producing a land cover dataset by applying a machine learning algorithm 
to multiple Earth observation datasets. Data can be used and processed at any scale, 
from small regions to entire continents.

This aspect of the :abbr:`ODC (Open Data Cube)` is for 
those who want to work with the data. This includes analysts and scientists.

To read more about working with data, see :doc:`accessing-data`.

ODC Software Packages
---------------------

The :abbr:`ODC (Open Data Cube)` has numerous :term:`Python` packages 
that provide additional functionality, such as web services and large scale processing. 
To read more about the packages, see :doc:`extensions`, which provides a 
description of each package and relevant links to their repositories.

Existing Deployments
--------------------

Many countries and organisations run their own Open Data Cubes, meaning 
you may be able to access data without needing to set up your own. 
To see a list of existing deployments, see :doc:`existing-deployments`.
