=================

For interactively exploring data in a Data Cube, we recommend using `Jupyter Notebooks`_.

.. _Jupyter Notebooks: https://jupyter.org/


Several GitHub repositories of example Open Data Cube notebooks are available, showing
how to access data through ODC, along with example algorithms and visualisations.
